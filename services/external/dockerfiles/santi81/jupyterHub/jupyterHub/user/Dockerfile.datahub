# This container image will be used by students with JupyterHub
#
# We split things into separate bash scripts that are then run from inside
# the container, rather than super long single lines with && in Docker.
# This is cleaner to understand and maintain in the long run. We trade off
# some docker build time cache for this, but gain in clarity and
# maintainability.
#
# Since we'll be mounting /home/jovyan from a persistent volume, anything
# you add in the docker file under /home/jovyan will never take effect.
